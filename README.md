## Introduction

**Project** - a unique and temporary endeavour that has a defined beginning and end, 
undertaken to create a specific product, service or result.

**Project Constraints** - limitations on what you do, how you do it and when you do it: 
  - Time constraint - time period within which you are to produce an end product or service.

  (e.g. Marketing, Operations, Finance). Used for simple projects.

#### Authority vs Influence

Conflict resolution:
  - **Confronting** (problem solving or collaboration). Finds a solution that is best for the project, 
  but not necessarily best for one party or another.
  - **Compromising** - take ideas from each party so that the solution is a little bit of each. 
  May not necessarily result in the best approach.
  - **Smoothing** (accommodating) - you seek to remind the parties in conflict  of their similarities.
  - **Forcing** (competing) - you simply tell people how it will be.
  - **Avoiding** - good when you are outranked.
